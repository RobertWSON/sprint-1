Without using jargon, how would you describe the command line to a lay person (eg your mum)?

The command line is a text based way for the user to communicate with the computer to do various tasks like for example creating files and viewing what's in folders or directories.

List 10 terminal commands and in plain english (ie with minimal technical jargon) describe what they do.

cd      changes to a particular folder that you want to go into.

mkdir   Makes a new folder in where you are.  

pwd     It stand for print working directory and it shows the name of the         folder that you are currently in 

cd ..   Moves up one folder.

ls      Lists all of the files and folders in a particular folder.

ls - a  Lists all of the contents in a folder and includes hidden files.

ls - l  Lists all of the contents in a folder in detail.

cp      Copy a file and place it in a another folder.

mv      Moves a file into another folder

rm      Deletes files


I hope this has explained the basics for you mum, have a great day.

Thanks
